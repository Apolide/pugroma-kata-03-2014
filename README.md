**Context**

You're a dev and you have to join on a new project, called Kata.<br/>
The code base of the project is already in a repo.<br/>
So, first you must get the code and run the tests to be sure you're up.<br/>


**Setup**

- fork the repo
- clone your fork in local: git clone git@github.com:your_github_name/pugroma-kata-03-2014.git pugroma-kata-03-2014
- install composer: curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
- install dependencies (phpunit): php composer.phar install --dev
- run test suite: bin/phpunit
- if tests are greens, you're up and ready to go

**Kata**

The kata will be available on 25 March 2014 at 19:30 ;-)
